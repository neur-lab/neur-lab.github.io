<h2>Research Areas</h2>
<p>
    Below are our main research topics. But these are not limits — we are open to any interesting idea.
</p>

<h3>Multimodal LLM</h3>
<p>
    We work with both Vision and NLP. Our goal is to improve the performance of current multimodal LLMs by exploring the structure, characteristics, and training strategies of vision encoders, LLMs, and multimodal connectors.
</p>

<h3>Document AI</h3>
<p>
    This includes both vision and language. We extract meaningful information from scene or digitized documents. Topics include OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and layout analysis. Recently, this field has grown with the help of LLMs or SLMs. It is a key area with high demand in industry.
</p>

<h3>Domain Generalization and Continual Learning</h3>
<p>
    Domain Generalization aims to improve performance on unseen data. Continual Learning focuses on reducing catastrophic forgetting in sequential learning. Both areas mainly target image classification. Future directions include applying to new tasks and building more general methods.
</p>

<h3>Topics of Interest</h3>

<h4>Training-free Model Fusion</h4>
<p>
    We aim to build better models by combining weights from existing ones, without extra training or with very low cost. Though still a young field, we find it very exciting. It’s risky but meaningful.
</p>

<h4>Reliable AI</h4>
<p>
    We focus on estimating uncertainty in LLM responses. This helps users understand the possibility of hallucinations. As LLMs are used more in general-purpose agents, this will become a core technology, possibly related to safety in some domains.
</p>

<h4>Video Generation</h4>
<p>
    This is an application area. While it’s not our main field and we have little direct experience, we are very interested. We want to generate meaningful videos — starting with visuals, then sound. It’s a creative space with fun challenges. GPU is key — but we’ll make it work.
